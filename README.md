# Neighborhood Map

A front-end web application that features a Google map of Thessaloniki, Greece using the [Google Maps APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/). The map includes highlighted locations and provides third-party data about those locations that is obtained using the [MediaWiki action API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page). Wikipedia content on each location is displayed within the infoWindow of each location's marker.
